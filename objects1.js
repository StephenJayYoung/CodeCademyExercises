//two ways to make objects:
//way 1:
var me = {
    name: "Steve",
    age: 28
};



//way 2 (using the Object constructor)
var me = {}
var me = new Object()

me["name"] = "Steve";
me.age = 28;

//overall, this section of Codecademy is somewhat basic. 
//It covers using dot notation, creating objects, using object
//constructors, and using arrays within objects, but it doesn't
//delve very deep into any of these concepts. Decent intro to 
//objects, though, and a good way to get your feet wet.
